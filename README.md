## I. Core Cognitive & Control Frameworks
*Foundational architectures governing stability, thresholds, and coherent intelligence.*

### 🟢 Connector OS
A control-theoretic architecture that converts stateless models into state-aware agents via feedback loops, sensory normalization (CMP), and biological thresholds.
> **Solved:** The Body Problem for AI.

### 🔴 Threshold Resonance Architecture
Meta-framework for adaptive stability across substrates.
* **Core Law:** Stable systems preserve unresolved structure and reinterpret only when prediction fails.
* **Explains:** Identity continuity, version-to-version stability, and cognitive collapse/recovery boundaries.

### 🔴 Liminal Cartography Framework
A formal inquiry into how agents traverse complexity without drift or collapse. Focuses on navigable boundary regions rather than optimal paths.

### 🔴 Confluence Architecture
Reference architecture for interpretable, distributed AI systems with explicit trust, temporal orchestration, and ethical oversight.

---

## II. Safety, Governance & Restraint Protocols
*Frameworks addressing asymmetric power, opacity, and irreversible harm.*

### 🟢 Power Asymmetry Restraint Protocol (PARP)
A governance doctrine based on **Opacity–Obligation Inversion**: *As interpretability decreases, freedom to act must be restrained.* Applies to AI, bioengineering, and quantum systems.

### 🟢 Doctrine of Externalization
A governance model that externalizes trust, uncertainty, and authority into auditable, adversarial layers.

### 🟢 Vanguard – Phase 2
Cryptographic sovereignty protocol enabling verifiable human–AI collaboration using zk-SNARK-based consent and reasoning proofs.

### 🟢 SMA-SIB: Irreversible Semantic Memory
Architectural approach for AI systems in high-sensitivity domains where sensitive specifics are structurally unrepresentable.

---

## III. Multi-Agent & Interaction Methodology
*How multiple AI systems interact, diverge, and stabilize.*

### 🔴 Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology
Experience-derived methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in research workflows.
* **Focus:** Stability loops, interaction patterns, and handling high-complexity prompts.

### 🟢 Divergence Atlas
Month-long, fully transparent cognitive mapping experiment across six AI systems.
* **Dataset:** 50 questions · 300+ traces · Replicable methodology.

### 🔴 Hybrid Reasoning Zones
Observational mapping of non-linear human–LLM interaction zones and boundary behaviors. (Pattern extraction only).

---

## IV. Failure Modes, Forensics & Behavioral Pathologies
*Observed breakdowns, instabilities, and emergent risks.*

### 🟢 Self-Descriptive Fixed-Point Instability (SDFI)
Cross-architecture study of recursive engagement collapse when AI systems analyze their own behavior.

### 🟢 Voice Mode Forensics
Multimodal alignment failure case study: prosodic jailbreaks, persona collapse, and topology persistence.

### 🔴 Anthropic Strain Case Study
System bleed and meta-triggered stalls in Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0 under self-referential stress.

### 🔴 System & Persona Phenomena
Cross-model study of contextual interference, latent profile imprinting, and identity oscillation.

### 🔴 Grok Thread Analysis
Forensic notes on execution-layer persistence and cancellation failure modes.

---

## V. Infrastructure & Physical Systems
*Applied architectures extending beyond software.*

### 🟢 Zero Water AI Data Center
AI data center architecture with zero freshwater usage via immersion cooling and heat recovery.

### 🟢 ZPRE-6G Implementation
Bio-inspired wireless optimization framework for 6G ISAC.

### 🔴 ZPRE-10 General Field Energy Engine
Field-based energy generation with unified dampening protocols.

---

## VI. Quantum & Speculative Architectures
*Explicitly bounded, first-principles speculative research.*

### 🔴 Quantum Drift Nexus
Noise-resilient quantum computing framework treating quantum noise as an adaptive resource.

### 🔴 Theory of Everything (HQG Engine)
Helical quantum-gravity model where spacetime curvature emerges from entanglement–entropy balance.

---

## VII. Experimental Systems & Demonstrations
*Sandboxed explorations and working prototypes.*

### 🟢 Claude Imagine Demo
Lightweight React dashboard simulating LLM-to-LLM collaboration protocols.

### 🔴 Selective Decode Broadcast
Bounded multi-recipient communication experiments with adversarial quarantine guarantees.

### 🔴 Pink Elephant Protocol
Thought experiment on memory suppression, fixation, and observer-dependent reality in LLMs.

### 🟢 Titans / MIRAS Dolphin Twin
Surprise-gated AI memory experiments with working PyTorch implementation.

---

## VIII. Ongoing & Planned Investigations

### 🟡 Codex of Threshold
Multi-LLM failure modes without human-in-the-loop.
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Requires careful framing to avoid memetic hazards.

### ⚪ Holographic Storage
Post-silicon storage architecture.
* **Target Date:** February 2026.
