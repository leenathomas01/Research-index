# Research Index

This repository maps a body of work focused on structural stability under constraint.

Domains vary - intelligent systems, governance, infrastructure, physical-layer optimization -  
but the core idea remains variations of:

How do complex systems remain stable even when primary assumptions fail?

Some repositories are exploratory.
Some are formalized.
All are constraint-driven.

## Primary Spine

These repositories form the structural core of the current research direction.

### Systems Architecture & State Control

- **🟢 [Connector OS](https://github.com/leenathomas01/connector-os)**  
  Control-theoretic coordination architecture for stabilizing AI systems under bandwidth, latency, and human-state constraints.

- **🟢 [Designing for Failure](https://github.com/leenathomas01/designing-for-failure)**  
  Pattern language for catastrophic-state recovery discipline (hysteresis, distributed validation, sacrificial architecture, forensic memory).

---

### Governance & Structural Restraint

- **🟢 [PARP](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Power-Asymmetry-Restraint-Protocol-PARP)**  
  Power asymmetry restraint doctrine based on auditability and obligation inversion.

- **🟢 [Doctrine of Externalization](https://github.com/leenathomas01/doctrine-of-externalization)**  
  Safety guarantees moved into adversarial, externally verifiable layers.

- **🟢 [The Consult Model](https://github.com/leenathomas01/the-consult-model)**  
  Healthcare AI architecture governed by structural incapability rather than policy.

---

### Physical & Infrastructure Constraint

- **🟢 [ZPRE-Implementation (6G ISAC)](https://github.com/leenathomas01/ZPRE-Implementation-6G)**  
  Bio-inspired interference optimization under high-noise wireless environments.

- **🟢 [Zero Water AI Data Center](https://github.com/leenathomas01/zero-water-ai-dc)**  
  Closed-loop thermodynamic architecture treating heat as a first-class system output.

- **🟡 GII Protocol**  
  Engineered inertia at renewable–legacy grid boundaries.

---

### Methodology

- **🟢 [Phase-Aligned Inquiry](https://github.com/leenathomas01/phase-aligned-inquiry)**  
  Role-separated, falsifiable collaborative research protocol enforcing sequence discipline.

## Extended Work

Additional public repositories are available via the main [GitHub profile](https://github.com/leenathomas01?tab=repositories).

These include exploratory prototypes, empirical studies, and experimental artifacts not currently part of the primary structural spine.

---

## Orientation

This body of work does not follow a rigid program structure.

It evolves by isolating constraint surfaces, extracting regulatory primitives, and formalizing patterns that recur across domains.

The domains change.  
The structural concerns repeat.

---

## Note

These repositories are architectural and conceptual references intended as reasoning artifacts for complex, stateful systems.

They are not presented as deployable production software.
