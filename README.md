## Cognitive & Safety Architecture

**Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology** 🔴  
A practical, experience‑derived methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in exploratory research, design, and reasoning workflows.
This repository contains three small, high-leverage documents that define a practical methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in exploratory, research, or design settings. These files focus on interaction patterns, stability loops, and safe handling of high-complexity prompts.

**Divergence Atlas** 🔴  
Month-long cognitive mapping experiment across 6 AI systems. 50 questions, 300+ reasoning traces.
This fully transparent, multi-agent cognitive mapping experiment was conducted across six advanced AI systems - Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 4, Perplexity, ChatGPT 5. The project began as a playful question ("What would each AI explore with the others?") and evolved into a structured, replicable methodology for understanding where AI systems converge, where they diverge, and why.

This repository documents the entire process—from idea generation to democratic selection, blind question creation, pilot testing, full-question execution, cross-system analysis, and post-analysis reflections.

**Connector OS** 🔴  
8-layer human-AI control architecture. Core claim: AI doesn't need more intelligence, it needs better integration.
If you're interested in:
- Adaptive control systems
- Human-AI co-regulation
- Signal normalization (CMP)
- Biofeedback loops
- State-based safety interlocks
- Experimental cognitive architectures
- Multimodal systems engineering
...this repo is for you.

**Vanguard Phase 2** 🔴  
Cryptographic sovereignty protocol for verifiable AI-human collaboration. zk-SNARK based consent mechanisms.

**Alien Lineage Protocol** 🔴  
Complete framework for coherent self-modifying intelligence. Non-biological survival laws derived from first principles.

**Hybrid Reasoning Zones** 🔴  
Observational mapping of non-linear human-LLM interaction zones. Focuses on boundary behaviors and variance signals.

**doctrine-of-externalization** 🔴

A governance doctrine for AI systems based on explicit oversight. Externalizes trust and uncertainty into auditable, adversarial, and constrainable layers.

**Confluence-Architecture** 🔴

A theoretical reference architecture exploring interpretable, distributed AI systems with explicit trust, temporal orchestration, and ethical oversight.

**Liminal-cartography-framework** 🔴

The LCF began as a conceptual and mathematical inquiry into how agents, human or synthetic, might traverse complexity without collapse or drift.
