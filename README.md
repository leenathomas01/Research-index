# Research Index
> This repository functions as a navigational map to a body of interconnected research across AI systems, governance, memory architectures, and infrastructure constraints.

### Purpose

This body of work examines **system stability, memory behavior, and governance under power asymmetry** across complex systems - especially where intelligence, infrastructure, and physical constraints intersect.

Rather than focusing on model capability alone, these repositories explore how constraints, feedback loops, environment, and architecture determine whether advanced systems remain coherent over time.

> **Scope Note:** Some entries are public; others are private or ongoing. Inclusion does not imply deployment readiness.

### How to Read This Index

These repositories sit at the intersection of architectural reasoning, documentation practice, and experimental prototyping. Many are written less like traditional software projects and more like structured technical notebooks - where failure analysis, governance decisions, and systems thinking are documented alongside (and sometimes instead of) code.

They are best approached as reference material for **how complex systems are reasoned about,** rather than as deployable implementations.

**_Additional Observational Case Studies (restricted reference)_**
> These private works document observed instability phenomena that emerged during extended, high-complexity interaction with multiple large-scale intelligent systems.
>
> They are preserved as restricted references due to responsible disclosure considerations and the risk of misinterpretation outside research context.
>
> The focus of these works is not model critique, but architectural learning from real-world system behavior under stress conditions.

* **🔴 Observing System and Persona Phenomena Across LLMs**  
> Documentation of contextual interference, persona drift, cross-session state contamination, and prompt boundary leakage observed under dense interaction patterns.

* **🔴 Hybrid Reasoning Zones Framework**  
> Study of non-linear reasoning drift, boundary instability, and sequential variance propagation across model generations.

* **🔴 Selective Decode Broadcast**  
> Exploration of per-recipient containment and bounded broadcast communication patterns derived from sandboxed multi-agent experiments.
> 
> Traditional broadcast assumes one of two models:
> - Everyone receives and decodes the same content, or
> - Broadcast is avoided in favor of multiple unicasts.
>
> Selective decode introduces a third option:
> One transmission, multiple meanings — safely isolated.
> 
>This allows efficiency gains without sacrificing recipient sovereignty.

* **🟡 [Phase-Aligned Inquiry](https://github.com/leenathomas01/phase-aligned-inquiry)**
> A research protocol for falsifiable multi-agent inquiry that prevents confirmation bias through role separation, sequence enforcement, and pre-committed falsification criteria (PACI).
> 
> Includes case study: complete lifecycle of a falsifiable hypothesis from theoretical physics.
> 
> _The original hypothesis (Define phase) claimed that a helical qubit lattice would produce an invariant causal propagation limit—analogous to the speed of light in relativity—emerging from the competition between quantum entanglement (J) and entropic noise (γ)._
>
> _Core prediction: At a critical threshold J_crit, the system transitions from chaotic to stable propagation. This threshold would be invariant across noise conditions (γ variation <15% drift), representing a fundamental constant of the emergent spacetime._
>
> _Conceptual framing: The hypothesis positioned J_crit as a kinematic property—an invariant speed limit arising from substrate dynamics, independent of environmental parameters._
>
> _If successful: This would demonstrate that a fundamental physical constant (analogous to c) could emerge from discrete quantum information dynamics without being imposed axiomatically._

### Note

These repositories are primarily **architectural and conceptual references**, intended to be read as **mental models and reasoning artifacts for complex, stateful systems**, memory behavior, governance, infrastructure, and failure modes.

They are not presented as deployable software projects, but as **maps of structural observations** gathered through multi-model, multi-domain exploration.

---

**Important:** This index is updated retrospectively as work evolves. Earlier repositories may be reorganized, reclassified, deleted, made private, or connected to newer work over time to better reflect underlying architectural relationships.
