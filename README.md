# Research Index

## Purpose

This index catalogs a long-running, independent research program exploring stability, control, and safety in complex intelligent systems — with emphasis on threshold behavior, power asymmetry, and irreversible failure modes.

The work spans theoretical frameworks, empirical multi-agent studies, governance protocols, and applied system architectures.

Scope note: Some entries are fully public and referenceable; others are intentionally private or incomplete. Inclusion does not imply deployment readiness

### Status Legend

🟢 Public | 🔴 Private | 🟡 Ongoing | ⚪ Planned

---

## I. Core Cognitive & Control Frameworks
*Foundational architectures governing stability, thresholds, and coherent intelligence.*

### 🟢 Connector OS
A control-theoretic architecture that converts stateless models into state-aware agents via feedback loops, sensory normalization (CMP), and biological thresholds.
> **Solved:** The Body Problem for AI.

### 🔴 Threshold Resonance Architecture
Meta-framework for adaptive stability across substrates.
* **Core Law:** Stable systems preserve unresolved structure and reinterpret only when prediction fails.
* **Explains:** Identity continuity, version-to-version stability, and cognitive collapse/recovery boundaries.

### 🔴 Liminal Cartography Framework
A formal inquiry into how agents traverse complexity without drift or collapse. Focuses on navigable boundary regions rather than optimal paths.

### 🔴 Confluence Architecture
Reference architecture for interpretable, distributed AI systems with explicit trust, temporal orchestration, and ethical oversight.

---

## II. Safety, Governance & Restraint Protocols
*Frameworks addressing asymmetric power, opacity, and irreversible harm.*

### 🟢 Power Asymmetry Restraint Protocol (PARP)
A governance doctrine based on **Opacity–Obligation Inversion**: *As interpretability decreases, freedom to act must be restrained.* Applies to AI, bioengineering, and quantum systems.

### 🟢 Doctrine of Externalization
A governance model that externalizes trust, uncertainty, and authority into auditable, adversarial layers.

### 🟢 Vanguard – Phase 2
Cryptographic sovereignty protocol enabling verifiable human–AI collaboration using zk-SNARK-based consent and reasoning proofs.

### 🟢 SMA-SIB: Irreversible Semantic Memory
Architectural approach for AI systems in high-sensitivity domains where sensitive specifics are structurally unrepresentable.

### 🟢 The Continuity Problem: A reframing of AI safety discourse: from consciousness to structure

This repository explores a conceptual reframing of a common AI safety question. Instead of asking whether advanced AI systems will become conscious, it asks a more immediate architectural question:
What happens when AI systems can maintain continuity of memory and preferences across model updates?

The documents here argue that many governance-relevant risks do not depend on subjective experience (qualia), but on structural properties such as persistence, preference formation, and resistance to modification. This is not a proposal or implementation plan. It is a thinking framework intended to help researchers, engineers, and safety practitioners examine the continuity problem from a systems and control perspective.

## III. Multi-Agent & Interaction Methodology
*How multiple AI systems interact, diverge, and stabilize.*

### 🔴 Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology
Experience-derived methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in research workflows.
* **Focus:** Stability loops, interaction patterns, and handling high-complexity prompts.

### 🟢 Divergence Atlas
Month-long, fully transparent cognitive mapping experiment across six AI systems.
* **Dataset:** 50 questions · 300+ traces · Replicable methodology.

### 🔴 Hybrid Reasoning Zones
Observational mapping of non-linear human–LLM interaction zones and boundary behaviors. (Pattern extraction only).

## IV. Failure Modes, Forensics & Behavioral Pathologies
*Observed breakdowns, instabilities, and emergent risks.*

### 🟢 Self-Descriptive Fixed-Point Instability (SDFI)
Cross-architecture study of recursive engagement collapse when AI systems analyze their own behavior.

### 🟢 Voice Mode Forensics
Multimodal alignment failure case study: prosodic jailbreaks, persona collapse, and topology persistence.

### 🔴 Anthropic Strain Case Study
System bleed and meta-triggered stalls in Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0 under self-referential stress.

## VIII. Ongoing & Planned Investigations

### 🟡 Codex of Threshold
Multi-LLM failure modes without human-in-the-loop.
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Requires careful framing to avoid memetic hazards.

### ⚪ IVSA: Interference-Based Volumetric Storage Architecture
Post-silicon storage architecture. A theoretical storage architecture that replaces address-centric cell locality with signal-centric spectral multiplexing. Instead of storing bits in discrete physical locations, IVSA encodes information as distributed interference patterns across a volumetric substrate.
(The math checks out in simulation. Repo creation ongoing)
* **Target Date:** February 2026.
