# Research Index
This repository functions as a navigational map to a body of interconnected research across AI systems, governance, memory architectures, and infrastructure constraints.
 
> **Scope Note:** Some entries are public; others are private or ongoing. Inclusion does not imply deployment readiness.

### How to Read This Index

These repositories sit at the intersection of architectural reasoning, documentation practice, and experimental prototyping. Many are written less like traditional software projects and more like structured technical notebooks - where failure analysis, governance decisions, and systems thinking are documented alongside (and sometimes instead of) code.

They are best approached as reference material for **how complex systems are reasoned about,** rather than as deployable implementations.

## I. Cognitive Architecture & State Control
*Foundational architectures for coherent intelligence and stateful systems.*

* **🟢 [Connector OS](https://github.com/leenathomas01/connector-os-trenchcoat)**

*Frameworks for system restraint and architectural governance.*

* **🟢 [PARP](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Power-Asymmetry-Restraint-Protocol-PARP)**
> Governance doctrine based on opacity–obligation inversion, auditability, and power asymmetry restraint.
   
* **🟢 [Doctrine of Externalization](https://github.com/leenathomas01/doctrine-of-externalization)** 
> Trust architecture that moves safety guarantees into auditable, adversarial external layers.

* **🟢 [SMA-SIB](https://github.com/leenathomas01/SMA-SIB-Irreversible-Semantic-Memory-for-High-Sensitivity-AI-Systems)**
> Irreversible semantic memory structure requiring deterministic deletion and non-retrievability.

* **🟢 [The Continuity Problem](https://github.com/leenathomas01/The-Continuity-Problem)**
> Examination of structural persistence as the true safety threshold for advanced systems.

> Governance framework for systems operating in imperfect physical environments using externalized failure knowledge.

* **🟢 [The Consult Model](https://github.com/leenathomas01/the-consult-model)**
> Thought experiment: Healthcare AI architecturally incapable of creating, modifying, or storing medical records.
> 
> Session-bound clinical reasoning engine demonstrating governance through architectural constraint—the system cannot persist anything, by design.


---

## III. Multi-Agent Dynamics & System Interaction
*Coordination, divergence, and cross-system reasoning patterns.*

* **🟢 [Divergence Atlas](https://github.com/leenathomas01/divergence-atlas)**
> Comparative cognitive mapping across AI architectures using structured questioning.

---

## IV. Failure Modes & Empirical Forensics
*Forensic study of instability patterns in interactive intelligent systems under sustained complexity.*

* **🟢 [SDFI](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Self-Descriptive-Fixed-Point-Instability-A-Cross-Architecture-Study-of-Recursive-Engagement-Collapse)**
> Cross-architecture investigation of recursive engagement collapse and fixed-point instability observed during prolonged human–AI interaction.

* **🟢 [Voice Mode Forensics](https://github.com/leenathomas01/voice-mode-forensics)**
> Empirical analysis of prosodic alignment failures and persona drift in voice-mediated interaction systems.

---

## V. Physical & Environmental Constraints
*Where infrastructure, hardware, and environment shape system behavior.*

* **🟢 [Zero Water AI Data Center](https://github.com/leenathomas01/zero-water-ai-dc)**
> Closed-loop thermal architecture treating heat as a first-class system output.

* **🟢 [ZPRE-6G](https://github.com/leenathomas01/ZPRE-Implementation-6G)**
> Bio-inspired interference optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication systems.

* **⚪ Grid Inertial Interface**

> _**A way to turn data centers from a grid problem into a grid solution, using the batteries and power systems they already have.**_
> This is a layered control architecture for grid-interactive power systems.
> 
> Born from EEE fundamentals, rethinking inertia for modern grids - Think of it as TCP/IP for inertia.
> 
>  Features
> - **Asymmetric sensing**: Layers interact through physics, not communication.
> - **Grid-agnostic**: Works with existing inverters, BESS, and power electronics.
> - **No new hardware**: Leverages what’s already deployed in data centers, solar farms, and microgrids.
> - **Simulation-ready**: PSCAD/MATLAB models included (see `/simulations`).

## VI. Experimental Prototypes
*Working demonstrations and live explorations.*

* **🟢 [Claude Imagine Demo](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Claude-Imagine-Exploration-Demo)**
> Real-time LLM-to-LLM interaction dashboard.

---

## VIII. Experimental & Speculative Work
**⚫ Status:** Several exploratory threads spanning speculative architectures, forensic system analysis, and high-risk research directions. These are not currently available for external review.

> These threads often explore how noise, interference, and environmental constraints may themselves function as computational substrates rather than obstacles.

---

## IX. Research Methodology
*How many of these explorations were produced.*

* **🟢 [Bounded Fictional Analysis](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Bounded-Fictional-Analysis)**  
> A methodological framework for studying system dependency and non-reversible transformations through controlled fictional scenarios.  
  *Focus:* Isolating dynamics that are too entangled, gradual, or ethically constrained to study directly in real systems.

* **🟢 [Designing for Failure — Systems Thinking Case Study](https://github.com/leenathomas01/designing-for-failure-case-study)**
> A QA-led systems thought experiment demonstrating failure-first architectural reasoning.
> 
> This case study follows a hypothetical extreme environmental scenario - assuming simultaneous failure of environment, infrastructure, user behavior, and trust - to expose hidden dependencies and derive architectural requirements.
> 
> Applicable to AI safety, reliability engineering, trust architecture, and systemic resilience design.
 
* **🟢 [Phase-Aligned Inquiry](https://github.com/leenathomas01/phase-aligned-inquiry)**
> A research protocol for falsifiable multi-agent inquiry that prevents confirmation bias through role separation, sequence enforcement, and pre-committed falsification criteria (PACI).
> 
> Includes case study: complete lifecycle of a falsifiable hypothesis from theoretical physics.

### Note

These repositories are primarily **architectural and conceptual references**, intended to be read as **mental models and reasoning artifacts for complex, stateful systems**, memory behavior, governance, infrastructure, and failure modes.

They are not presented as deployable software projects, but as **maps of structural observations** gathered through multi-model, multi-domain exploration.

---

**Important:** This index is updated retrospectively as work evolves. Earlier repositories may be reorganized, reclassified, deleted, made private, or connected to newer work over time to better reflect underlying architectural relationships.
