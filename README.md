# Research Index

### Purpose

This work approaches AI safety through system stability, memory behavior, and governance under power asymmetry, rather than model capability alone.

> **Scope Note:** Some entries are public; others are private or ongoing. Inclusion does not imply deployment readiness.

### Status Legend
🟢 Public | 🔴 Private | 🟡 Ongoing | ⚪ Planned | ⚫ Experimental

---

## I. Cognitive Architecture & State Control
*Foundational architectures for coherent intelligence.*

* **🟢 [Connector OS](https://github.com/leenathomas01/connector-os-trenchcoat)**  
  Control-theoretic architecture converting stateless models into state-aware agents via feedback loops, sensory normalization, and biological thresholds.  
  *Focus:* Addressing the "Body Problem" for AI.

* **🔴 Shape Memory Architecture (SMA)**  
  Model-agnostic memory architecture achieving persistence without storing text or PII.  
  * No linguistic storage (reconstruction, not retrieval).  
  * Continuity across model versions.  
  * Deterministic deletion via destruction of discrete memory units.

* **🔴 Semantic Capsule Protocol (SCP)**  
  Minimal protocol for storing and exchanging semantic constraints without language, transcripts, or embeddings.
