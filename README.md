# Research Index
> This repository functions as a navigational map to a body of interconnected research across AI systems, governance, memory architectures, and infrastructure constraints.

### Purpose

This body of work examines **system stability, memory behavior, and governance under power asymmetry** across complex systems - especially where intelligence, infrastructure, and physical constraints intersect.

Rather than focusing on model capability alone, these repositories explore how constraints, feedback loops, environment, and architecture determine whether advanced systems remain coherent over time.

> **Scope Note:** Some entries are public; others are private or ongoing. Inclusion does not imply deployment readiness.

**_Additional Observational Case Studies (restricted reference)_**

These private works document observed instability phenomena that emerged during extended, high-complexity interaction with multiple large-scale intelligent systems.

They are preserved as restricted references due to responsible disclosure considerations and the risk of misinterpretation outside research context.

The focus of these works is not model critique, but architectural learning from real-world system behavior under stress conditions.

> Documentation of contextual interference, persona drift, cross-session state contamination, and prompt boundary leakage observed under dense interaction patterns.

* **🔴 Hybrid Reasoning Zones Framework**

### Note

These repositories are primarily **architectural and conceptual references**, intended to be read as **mental models for reasoning about complex, stateful systems**, memory behavior, governance, infrastructure, and failure modes.

They are not presented as deployable software projects, but as **maps of structural observations** gathered through multi-model, multi-domain exploration.

---

**Important:** This index is updated retrospectively as work evolves. Earlier repositories may be reorganized, reclassified, deleted, made private, or connected to newer work over time to better reflect underlying architectural relationships.
