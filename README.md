# Research Index

This repository functions as a navigational map to a structured body of interconnected research across AI systems, governance, memory architectures, and infrastructure constraints.

> Entries vary in maturity (public, experimental, or under active development). Inclusion does not imply production deployment.

## Research Program Structure

This body of work progresses through three stages:

1. **Exploratory Modeling** — Structural reasoning artifacts and failure analysis  
2. **Architectural Consolidation** — Formalized frameworks and versioned releases  
3. **Cross-Domain Translation** — Applying regulatory principles across infrastructure domains  

**Connector OS (v1.0, Feb 2026)** marks the first fully consolidated architectural release within this arc.

---

## Recent Structural Update — February 2026

- **Connector OS v1.0 Whitepaper Released**  
  *Architecture Before Scale — A Control-Theoretic Framework for Stable AI Systems*  
  → Available in the Connector OS repository (tag: `whitepaper-v1.0`)

- Added: The Consult Model (Healthcare AI governance architecture)

- Added: Phase-Aligned Inquiry (multi-agent falsifiable research protocol)

- Designing for Failure: moved to private for expansion into survivability methodology

- Ongoing:  
  - GII Protocol (engineered inertia for legacy grid stability)  
  - IVSA (interference-based volumetric storage architecture)

- Planned:  
  - NAND flash architecture improvements  
  - Digital embodied agents design
