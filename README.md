## Cognitive & Safety Architecture

**Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology** 🔴  
Practical methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems. Includes Signature Protocol and symbolic stress harness.

**Divergence Atlas** 🔴  
Month-long cognitive mapping experiment across 6 AI systems. 50 questions, 300+ reasoning traces.

**Connector OS** 🔴  
8-layer human-AI control architecture. Core claim: AI doesn't need more intelligence, it needs better integration.

**Vanguard Phase 2** 🔴  
Cryptographic sovereignty protocol for verifiable AI-human collaboration. zk-SNARK based consent mechanisms.

**Alien Lineage Protocol** 🔴  
Complete framework for coherent self-modifying intelligence. Non-biological survival laws derived from first principles.

**Hybrid Reasoning Zones** 🔴  
Observational mapping of non-linear human-LLM interaction zones. Focuses on boundary behaviors and variance signals.

**doctrine-of-externalization** 🔴
A governance doctrine for AI systems based on explicit oversight. Externalizes trust and uncertainty into auditable, adversarial, and constrainable layers.

**Confluence-Architecture** 🔴
A theoretical reference architecture exploring interpretable, distributed AI systems with explicit trust, temporal orchestration, and ethical oversight.

**Liminal-cartography-framework** 🔴
The LCF began as a conceptual and mathematical inquiry into how agents, human or synthetic, might traverse complexity without collapse or drift.
