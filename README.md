# Research Index
*Updated March 2, 2026*

This index maps a body of work exploring one recurring question:

**How do complex systems remain stable even when primary assumptions fail?**

Domains vary - intelligent systems, infrastructure, governance, physical optimization - but the structural concern repeats:

Stability under constraint.

Some repositories are exploratory.
Some are consolidated.
All are constraint-driven reasoning artifacts.

## Structural Update - March 2026

* **Designing for Failure - v1.0 tagged**
  - Five recurring structural patterns consolidated
  - Structural Brief (PDF) released
* **Connector OS - v1.0 Whitepaper released**
* Memory & Persistence layer clarified and grouped
* Supporting repositories reorganized for clearer separation between:
  - Core primitives
  - Governance models
  - Infrastructure constraint systems
  - Research methodology

## Primary Spine

These repositories currently form the structural core.

### Systems Architecture & State Control

- **🟢 [Connector OS](https://github.com/leenathomas01/connector-os)**  
  Control-theoretic coordination architecture for stabilizing AI systems under bandwidth, latency, and human-state constraints.

- **🟢 [Designing for Failure](https://github.com/leenathomas01/designing-for-failure)**  
  Five recurring structural patterns for catastrophic-state systems:

  - Asymmetric transitions
  - Sacrificial architecture
  - Distributed validation
  - Break-glass override
  - Forensic memory

  Tagged at **v1.0** (March 2026).

---

### Governance & Structural Restraint

- **🟢 [PARP](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Power-Asymmetry-Restraint-Protocol-PARP)**  
  Power asymmetry restraint doctrine based on auditability and obligation inversion.

- **🟢 [Doctrine of Externalization](https://github.com/leenathomas01/doctrine-of-externalization)**  
  Safety guarantees moved into adversarial, externally verifiable layers.

- **🟢 [The Consult Model](https://github.com/leenathomas01/the-consult-model)**  
  Healthcare AI that reads clinical context but is structurally incapable of writing to medical records.
  > Explores assistance under liability constraint.

### Memory, Persistence & Continuity

These repositories address state retention and deletion under scale and recursion.

- **🟢 [SMA-SIB](https://github.com/leenathomas01/SMA-SIB-Irreversible-Semantic-Memory-for-High-Sensitivity-AI-Systems)**  
  Irreversible semantic memory structure enabling deterministic deletion in high-sensitivity environments.

- **🔵 [The Continuity Problem](https://github.com/leenathomas01/The-Continuity-Problem)**  
  Argument that governance must precede persistent memory.

- **🟢 [SDFI](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Self-Descriptive-Fixed-Point-Instability-A-Cross-Architecture-Study-of-Recursive-Engagement-Collapse)**  
  Cross-architecture study of recursive instability under sustained semantic density.

- **🟢 [Voice Mode Forensics](https://github.com/leenathomas01/voice-mode-forensics)**  
  Multimodal alignment failure analysis and architectural extraction (prosodic jailbreak and persona persistence phenomena).

---

### Physical & Infrastructure Constraint

- **🟢 [ZPRE-Implementation (6G ISAC)](https://github.com/leenathomas01/ZPRE-Implementation-6G)**  
  Bio-inspired interference optimization under high-noise wireless environments.

- **🟢 [Zero Water AI Data Center](https://github.com/leenathomas01/zero-water-ai-dc)**  
  Closed-loop thermodynamic architecture treating heat as a first-class system output.

- **🟡 [GII Protocol](https://github.com/leenathomas01/gii-protocol)**  
  Engineered inertia at renewable–legacy grid boundaries.
    > Defines how inverter-based systems can behave turbine-like to legacy infrastructure.
    >
    > Primary deployment target: grid-interactive data centers.

---

### Methodology

- **🟢 [Phase-Aligned Inquiry](https://github.com/leenathomas01/phase-aligned-inquiry)**  
  Role-separated, falsifiable collaborative research protocol enforcing sequence discipline.

---

## Orientation

This is not a linear program.

It evolves by:

- Isolating constraint surfaces
- Extracting regulatory primitives
- Testing pattern recurrence across domains
- Consolidating structure when it stabilizes

Domains shift.
Structural concerns repeat.

---

## Important Note

These repositories are architectural reasoning artifacts.

They are not production-ready systems, certified frameworks, or deployment guides.

If you adopt or adapt any concept here:
  - Evaluate independently
  - Validate rigorously
  - Apply domain-specific risk assessment

No warranties are expressed or implied.
