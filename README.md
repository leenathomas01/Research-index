## I. Core Cognitive & Control Frameworks
*Foundational architectures for coherent intelligence.*

* **🟢 Connector OS**
  Control-theoretic architecture converting stateless models into state-aware agents via feedback loops, sensory normalization, and biological thresholds.
  * *Focus:* Addressing the "Body Problem" for AI.
* **🔴 Shape Memory Architecture (SMA)**
  Model-agnostic memory architecture achieving persistence without storing text or PII.
  * No linguistic storage (reconstruction, not retrieval).
  * Continuity across model versions.
  * Deterministic deletion via destruction of discrete memory units.

## II. Safety, Governance & Restraint Protocols
*Frameworks for power asymmetry and system restraint.*

* **🟢 PARP:** Opacity–Obligation Inversion governance doctrine.
* **🟢 Doctrine of Externalization:** Trust moved into auditable adversarial layers.
* **🔴 Vanguard – Phase 2:** zk-SNARK–based human–AI sovereignty protocol.
* **🟢 SMA-SIB:** Structural irreversibility for high-sensitivity domains.
* **🟢 The Continuity Problem:** Structural persistence as the real AI safety threshold.
* **🟢 Embodied Agent Governance:** External failure knowledge for embodied agents.

## III. Multi-Agent & Interaction Methodology
*Coordination and divergence patterns.*

* **🔴 Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology:** Stability loops for high-complexity AI coordination.
* **🟢 Divergence Atlas:** 50-question cognitive mapping across six AI systems.

## IV. Failure Modes & Forensics
*Empirical study of system breakdowns.*

* **🟢 SDFI:** Recursive engagement collapse across architectures.
* **🟢 Voice Mode Forensics:** Prosodic alignment failures and persona collapse.

## V. Infrastructure & Physical Systems
*Hardware and environmental optimization.*

* **🟢 Zero Water AI Data Center:** Immersion cooling, zero freshwater use.
* **🟢 ZPRE-6G:** Bio-inspired optimization for 6G ISAC.

## VI. Experimental Systems
*Working prototypes and demonstrations.*

* **🟢 Claude Imagine Demo:** LLM-to-LLM collaboration dashboard (React).
* **🟢 Titans / MIRAS Dolphin Twin:** Surprise-gated memory experiments (PyTorch).

## VII. Ongoing & Planned
*Future-facing architectures.*

* **⚪ IVSA — Interference-Based Volumetric Storage**
  Post-silicon storage via spectral multiplexing in volumetric substrate. Simulation validated; repository in preparation.
  * **Target:** February 2026.
