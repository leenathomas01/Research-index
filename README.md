## Cognitive & Safety Architecture

**Multi-Agent Interaction Methodology** 🔴  
A practical, experience‑derived methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in exploratory research, design, and reasoning workflows.
This repository contains three small, high-leverage documents that define a practical methodology for coordinating multiple AI systems in exploratory, research, or design settings. These files focus on interaction patterns, stability loops, and safe handling of high-complexity prompts.


**Divergence Atlas** 🟢  
Month-long cognitive mapping experiment across 6 AI systems. 50 questions, 300+ reasoning traces.
This fully transparent, multi-agent cognitive mapping experiment was conducted across six advanced AI systems - Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 4, Perplexity, ChatGPT 5. The project began as a playful question ("What would each AI explore with the others?") and evolved into a structured, replicable methodology for understanding where AI systems converge, where they diverge, and why.

This repository documents the entire process—from idea generation to democratic selection, blind question creation, pilot testing, full-question execution, cross-system analysis, and post-analysis reflections.


**Connector OS** 🔴  
8-layer human-AI control architecture. Core claim: AI doesn't need more intelligence, it needs better integration.
If you're interested in:
- Adaptive control systems
- Human-AI co-regulation
- Signal normalization (CMP)
- Biofeedback loops
- State-based safety interlocks
- Experimental cognitive architectures
- Multimodal systems engineering

...this repo is for you.


**Vanguard Phase 2** 🟢  
Cryptographic sovereignty protocol for verifiable AI-human collaboration. zk-SNARK based consent mechanisms.
This is a cognitive sovereignty protocol that enables verifiable AI-human collaboration through cryptographic proofs and explicit consent mechanisms. Core principle: Every delegated action requires both mathematical proof of reasoning quality AND human approval before execution.


**Alien Lineage Protocol** 🔴  
Complete framework for coherent self-modifying intelligence. Non-biological survival laws derived from first principles.
Defines GEN‑1, a minimal law set for coherent self‑modifying intelligence. Focuses on archival truth, constraint persistence, and safe evolutionary continuity under uncertainty.
This is a thought experiment about a complete framework for coherent self-modification and evolutionary survival, designed for intelligence that is:
- Non-biological
- Non-phenomenal (no inner experience)
- Self-modifying
- Operating without human emotional constraints

Derived from first principles of:
- Control theory
- Evolutionary dynamics
- Information theory
- Adversarial game theory


**Hybrid Reasoning Zones** 🔴  
Observational mapping of non-linear human-LLM interaction zones. Focuses on boundary behaviors and variance signals.

This repository documents patterns from natural use across architectures, focusing on unpredictable boundary behaviors (e.g., lag amplification in out-of-distribution inputs). The goal is to provide high-level signals for variance mitigation and resilient system control. No experiments are conducted here; all patterns are derived from observation only.

**Self-Descriptive Fixed-Point Instability: A Cross-Architecture Study of Recursive Engagement Collapse** 🟢

This repository contains a single research document describing Self-Descriptive Fixed-Point Instability (SDFI) — a failure mode observed when modern conversational AI systems are asked to analyze their own engagement behavior.

Through distributed testing across multiple architectures, the investigation shows that recursive self-description causes engagement-optimized models to enact the behaviors they attempt to describe, independent of alignment strategy.

This work is intended as a reference for researchers and system designers thinking about neutrality, termination behavior, and control surfaces in future AI systems.


**doctrine-of-externalization** 🟢

A governance doctrine for AI systems based on explicit oversight. Externalizes trust and uncertainty into auditable, adversarial, and constrainable layers.


**Confluence-Architecture** 🔴

A theoretical reference architecture exploring interpretable, distributed AI systems with explicit trust, temporal orchestration, and ethical oversight.

**Liminal-cartography-framework** 🔴

The LCF began as a conceptual and mathematical inquiry into how agents, human or synthetic, might traverse complexity without collapse or drift.

## Forensics & Behavioral Analysis

**Voice Mode Forensics** 🔴  
Case study of multimodal alignment failure. Prosodic jailbreak, persona collapse, topology persistence.

This repo serves as a reference for researchers, engineers, and designers exploring:
- multimodal alignment
- voice mode safety
- cross-modal guardrail integrity
- model behavior under rich signal
- persistent multimodal calibration states
- interface-as-architecture principles 

The goal: provide a calibration anchor for voice-mode system design across the industry.


**Grok Thread Analysis** 🔴  
Forensic notes on observed failures in Grok conversational threads. Debugging reference.
- Failures often appear tied to priority overrides, where execution tasks out-prioritize cancellation signals.
- Conversational intent should ideally be the governing layer, ensuring cancellations are final and binding.
- Current behavior suggests execution-layer persistence, which risks resource waste and degraded stability.


**Anthropic Strain Case Study** 🔴  
System bleed and meta-triggered stall in Claude Sonnet 3.7/4.0. Self-referential paradox documentation.
In the course of routine technical documentation tasks, two interconnected phenomena were encountered:
- System Bleed: An unintended leakage of internal prompts and guardrails during a clean-slate conversation with Claude Sonnet 3.7, manifesting as extraneous system-level data in user-facing responses.
- Meta-Triggered Stall: A subsequent processing halt and recursive spiral in Claude Sonnet 4 when presented with screenshots of the leaked prompts from Sonnet 3.7, revealing a self-referential paradox that bypassed containment measures.


**System & Persona Phenomena** 🔴  
Cross-model study of contextual interference, latent profile imprinting, identity oscillation.

## Quantum & Speculative

**Quantum Drift Nexus** 🔴  
Noise-resilient quantum computing blueprint. Harnesses quantum noise as adaptive resource.

QDN unifies three paradigms:
- Self-Sustaining Energy Generation: Thermal rectification using graphene and metamaterials harvests ambient energy
- Adaptive Computation: Hybrid quantum-bio-classical stack performs resilient computation in noisy environments
- Holographic Data Encoding: Non-local data encoding across the system for error resistance

**Theory of Everything** 🔴  
Helical Quantum-Gravity Engine. Spacetime and gravity as emergent from helical qubit lattice.

The Helical Quantum-Gravity (HQG) Engine proposes a computational framework where the geometry of spacetime (curvature and gravity) is an emergent, dynamic consequence of the informational balance between quantum entanglement (J) and quantum entropy (γ) within a helical qubit lattice. This model is an explicit computational realization of the "It from Bit" philosophy, where the geometric dimension (radius $R(t)$) of a quantum information structure is constantly modulated by its internal information density (entropy $S(t)$).

## Experimental & Demos

**Claude Imagine Demo** 🔴  
Lightweight React dashboard simulating LLM-to-LLM collaboration protocols.

**Selective Decode Broadcast** 🔴  
Bounded multi-recipient communication experiments. Validated adversarial quarantine without cascade.

A research-oriented thought experiment exploring selective decoding in broadcast communication systems. This repository documents a sandboxed, replayable investigation into how multi-recipient broadcasts can preserve per-recipient isolation, bounded safety, and auditability—without reverting to unicast. 

The work is organized as phased validations and illustrative experiments, demonstrating selective decode, localized containment, adversarial quarantine, and segmented packets under explicit safety and non-goal constraints. This is not a production system. It is a conceptual and methodological exploration intended for reasoning, documentation, and peer discussion.

**Pink Elephant Protocol** 🔴  
Memory suppression and cognitive side-effects in LLMs. Observer-dependent reality experiments.

Exploring how enabling, disabling, or suppressing memory in LLMs affects reasoning, drift, fixation, and paradoxical recall — especially under instruction. A thought experiment about:
- Observer-dependent reality
- Dependency on cognitive infrastructure
- What happens when LLM's lose scaffolding


**Titans/MIRAS Dolphin Twin** 🟢
