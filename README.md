# Research Index

This repository maps a body of work focused on structural stability under constraint.

Domains vary - intelligent systems, governance, infrastructure, physical-layer optimization -  
but the core idea remains variations of:

How do complex systems remain stable even when primary assumptions fail?

Some repositories are exploratory.
Some are formalized.
All are constraint-driven.

### Read Me First

If you are arriving from traditional software, AI product development, or infrastructure implementation contexts, some of these repositories may initially feel unconventional.

They are not production-ready systems or turnkey deployment guides.

They are architectural reasoning artifacts focused on **stability under constraint** - whether computational, physical, governance-based, or human.

Across domains -  intelligent systems, grid infrastructure, thermodynamic limits, wireless interference, or institutional governance - the recurring premise is:

> Stability is an architectural property.
> 
> Scale amplifies whatever architecture exists.

Many repositories invert common design instincts:
- Failure is designed and bounded, not eliminated.
- Safety is treated as a control problem, not a policy overlay.
- Constraints (latency, inertia, heat, load, authority asymmetry) are first-class design variables.
- Human interaction is modeled as dynamic system state, not static control.

If you are looking for deployable applications, these may not serve that purpose directly.

If you are interested in regulatory structure, failure isolation, constraint translation, and resilience across domains, please proceed.

Use what is useful.

## Primary Spine

These repositories form the structural core of the current research direction.

### Systems Architecture & State Control

- **🟢 [Connector OS](https://github.com/leenathomas01/connector-os)**  
  Control-theoretic coordination architecture for stabilizing AI systems under bandwidth, latency, and human-state constraints.

- **🟢 [Designing for Failure](https://github.com/leenathomas01/designing-for-failure)**  
  Pattern language for catastrophic-state recovery discipline (hysteresis, distributed validation, sacrificial architecture, forensic memory).

---

### Governance & Structural Restraint

- **🟢 [PARP](https://github.com/leenathomas01/Power-Asymmetry-Restraint-Protocol-PARP)**  
  Power asymmetry restraint doctrine based on auditability and obligation inversion.

- **🟢 [Doctrine of Externalization](https://github.com/leenathomas01/doctrine-of-externalization)**  
  Safety guarantees moved into adversarial, externally verifiable layers.

- **🟢 [The Consult Model](https://github.com/leenathomas01/the-consult-model)**  
  Healthcare AI architecture governed by structural incapability rather than policy.

---

### Physical & Infrastructure Constraint

- **🟢 [ZPRE-Implementation (6G ISAC)](https://github.com/leenathomas01/ZPRE-Implementation-6G)**  
  Bio-inspired interference optimization under high-noise wireless environments.

- **🟢 [Zero Water AI Data Center](https://github.com/leenathomas01/zero-water-ai-dc)**  
  Closed-loop thermodynamic architecture treating heat as a first-class system output.

- **🟡 GII Protocol**  
  Engineered inertia at renewable–legacy grid boundaries.
  > GII defines how an inertia-providing device must behave so that renewables can appear turbine-like to the legacy grid.

---

### Methodology

- **🟢 [Phase-Aligned Inquiry](https://github.com/leenathomas01/phase-aligned-inquiry)**  
  Role-separated, falsifiable collaborative research protocol enforcing sequence discipline.

## Extended Work

Additional public repositories are available via the main [GitHub profile](https://github.com/leenathomas01?tab=repositories).

These include exploratory prototypes, empirical studies, and experimental artifacts not currently part of the primary structural spine.

---

## Orientation

This body of work does not follow a rigid program structure.

It evolves by isolating constraint surfaces, extracting regulatory primitives, and formalizing patterns that recur across domains.

The domains change.  
The structural concerns repeat.

---

## Note

These repositories are architectural and conceptual references intended as reasoning artifacts for complex, stateful systems.

They are not presented as deployable production software.
